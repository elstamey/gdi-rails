### Tech requirements:

 Please prepare for this class by setting up your development environment_, following this guide: http://docs.railsbridge.org/installfest/. If you encounter any problems or have questions about the process, please ask on the event page?. 
 - A modern web browser - either Chrome or Firefox with Firebug installed.
 - A text editor. We recommend Sublime Text 2 (free; available for Mac, PC, and Linux).


### Topics covered:

Ready to build on your basic Ruby knowledge to start building full web applications? It's time to learn Rails! 

Rails is a framework that makes creating web applications relatively quick and easy. There is a thriving community around it, a strong job market, and ample resources available to beginners. Rails powers applications like Living Social, Groupon, Twitter, Square, Github and more.

Through classroom instruction, group excercises, and homework, you'll get a solid introduction to the fundamentals of building Rails applications. By the end of the course, you'll have built at least three complete web apps, including a blogging framework with user authentication, and you'll have the knowledge and resources to continue building.

This class runs for four weeks:

 - Class 1: Intro to Rails
 - Class 2: Working With Objects
 - Class 3: Active Record In Depth
 - Class 4: Deploying to Heroku & Professional Best Practices

Note: To get the most out of this course, you'll need a modicum of Ruby knowledge. If you didn't attend our recent Intro to Ruby course, I would recommend working through at least some of Code Academy's Ruby Track to prepare: http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/ruby

At this time, you will need to provide your own laptop - PC or Mac - to participate in the course.
